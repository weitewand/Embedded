#### by Kai Qian, David den Haring, Li Cao

### Short Summary

Book about embedded systems. Focuses on the software design but also says a thing or two about the hardware for embedded systems. Also a focus on labs and hands on activities with a certain microcontroller. *I will have to see if I can do the same thing with a microcontroller I have at hand. Or just do similar stuff I can do.*
