  - Is there any reason to use a microprocesser instead of a microcontroller?
    - Maybe less energy consumption and space needed, if you taylor the needed peripherals exactly to your needes (applies only to mass produced embedded systems)
    - A normal PC (though not an embedded system) uses a microprosessor (the CPU) and all the peripherals are on the motherboard. at least when I build my own PCs, a modern Mac may have it all integreated on one chip).
  - What is an OSC?
  - What is parallel/serial exactly? Which devices uses what kind of communication? How do these blocks in a microcontroller work? (see Qian et al 2009, p. 6)
    - parallel: external memory, data [Qian et al 2009, p. 6]
    - serial: PC, modem, wireless, ethernet [Qian et al 2009, p. 6]
 - What does it mean that the accumulator register can be used as an operand? (Qian et al 2009, p.7)
 - What is a MDA?
